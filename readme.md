## âœ… Test Case Documentation
- The test cases are documented in the `cypress/support/fixtures` folder.

## ðŸ’» Test Report
- I implemented automated tests using Cypress following the Page Object pattern, which enhances the project's scalability and code reusability.
- I chose not to use Cucumber for writing test cases, as I believe it would add an unnecessary layer of complexity. The key focus is to keep tests highly readable for easy understanding, and given this, I donâ€™t see the need for Cucumber.
- Additional improvements include cross-browser and cross-device testing, performance validation, and automation for regression testing, ensuring a more comprehensive and reliable quality assessment.
